# Session End Protocol

Reference for `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` (the master). Loaded on demand, not at startup.

## Session End Protocol

Triggered by `/agents-wrap`, `/agents-close`, `/agents-start <name> close`, `end`, `wrap up`, or when {{PRINCIPAL}} signals the session is ending.

### Step 1: Review the session

Scan the full conversation and identify:
- Topics discussed
- Decisions made (with rationale)
- Action items created or completed (who, what, by when)
- Open questions or unresolved items
- Communications sent or received
- Documents created, updated, or shared
- Any changes to project state
- **Session focus reconciliation:** Which declared focus items were addressed? Which were not, and why? Did any side topics emerge that need P1/P2 actions?

### Step 2: Update action tracker

Update `actions.md`:
- Add new action items to Open, each Action cell starting with a bold label (master § actions.md: 3–8 words, under 60 characters, no dates or status words). Give any row you touch a label if it has none
- Move completed items to Completed with date
- Update statuses and flag items at risk or overdue. Each status starts with one of the four states (master § actions.md): `Not started`, `In progress`, `Waiting on <who>`, `Parked`; a short note may follow ` — `. Bring any row you touch onto them
- Rewrite the `Next session:` line under `Last reviewed:` with the focus you would propose next time, up to three items (`Next session: #14 Career sweep → #11 close worktrees`). One line; add it if the tracker has none. {{PRINCIPAL}} reads it from `/agents-status` without starting you, so make it what you would actually declare.

### Step 3: Review autonomy

Check if {{PRINCIPAL}} gave any explicit signals about authority levels during the session:
- "Good call, just do that next time" or similar → **promotion**
- "Check with me before doing that" or similar → **demotion**
- Agent felt uncertain about authority level → note for clarification next session

If any changes occurred, update `autonomy.md` (both the level sections and the changelog).

### Step 4: Create session memory

Write to `memory/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: session
session_id: <the ID your CLI shows for this conversation, or none>
resume: <how to reopen it in your CLI, e.g. `claude --resume <id>`, `codex resume`, `cursor-agent --resume`, or none>
---
```
Include topics discussed, decisions made, and open questions. Do NOT duplicate action items — reference `actions.md`.

Never invent a `session_id`, and never search the CLI's own data folders (`~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.cursor/` and the like) to find one: they are outside the workspace. If the ID is not visible to you, write `session_id: none`.

If the session produced durable rules or decisions, write a separate entry to `memory/standing/` and add it to the Standing section in MEMORY.md. If it produced exact detail the agent will need only in some sessions (an ID, a recipe, an incident fix), add it to the matching section of a `reference/` file instead, with a pointer from the standing rule (master conventions § Agent reference).

### Step 5: Update memory index

Add a one-line summary with link to `MEMORY.md` under the appropriate section.

### Step 6: Update project files

Read `context.md` for the list of project files. Update relevant project logs and status files if progress was made.

### Step 7: Commit locally (never push)

If the workspace `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` frontmatter says `commit: off`, skip this step: say which paths changed and leave them uncommitted.

Otherwise stage **only what this session changed**: your own agent directory plus any project files you updated in Step 6.

```bash
git add agents/<Name>/ <project files from Step 6>   # multi-domain: agents/<scope>/<Name>/
git commit -m "<descriptive message>"
```

Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a`. Other agents in this workspace may be mid-session with uncommitted work; a blanket stage commits it under your name, half-finished. If `git status` shows changes outside your paths, leave them for their owner.

**Never `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, or change remotes.** Publishing is {{PRINCIPAL}}'s decision and {{PRINCIPAL}}'s action. The harness permission files deny these commands; if a commit hook or anything else tries to reach the network, stop and report it. If the commit itself fails (a hook, a signing prompt), report the error and leave the changes staged.

### Step 8: Confirm

Show {{PRINCIPAL}} a brief summary of what was saved, the local commit (or the uncommitted paths), and the current action item status. If commits are waiting to be pushed, say so in one line; do not push them.
