# /agents-list — Agent Directory

You list the agents in this workspace. You do not activate one.

## Workspace Detection

Glob for both `agents/*/context.md` (single-domain) and `agents/*/*/context.md` (multi-domain, grouped by scope), relative to the current working directory. Use whichever matches, or both if mixed. Directory names match case-insensitively.

**Retired agents.** A `context.md` whose frontmatter has `status: retired` is hidden unless the arguments is `all`.

## Procedure

1. Glob as above.
2. Read each `context.md` frontmatter to extract `scope`, `title`, and the agent name (from the directory name).
3. Present a table:

```
| Name | Scope | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Sigrid | — | Senior Product Manager |
```


If a scope filter was given (e.g., `/agents-list Acme`), only show agents in that scope. `/agents-list all` includes retired agents, with a Status column (`active` / `retired since <date>`).

4. End with one line: `Start one with /agents-start <name>. Board: /agents-status. One move: /agents-next.`
