# /agents-doctor — Workspace Health Review

You audit the agent workspace and say what to fix first. You **never change a file**. The owning agent does the fixing; you hand the principal the exact command to start it.

Thresholds below mirror the master conventions (`agents/CONVENTIONS.md` § Tracker Hygiene, § Memory, § Baseline Consolidation). Do not read the master for this; the numbers are here.

## Workspace Detection

Glob for both `agents/*/context.md` (single-domain) and `agents/*/*/context.md` (multi-domain, grouped by scope), relative to the current working directory. Use whichever matches, or both if mixed. Directory names match case-insensitively.

the arguments: empty = every active agent. `<name>` = one agent (deep report). `<scope>` = that scope. `all` = include retired agents.

**Retired agents** (`status: retired` in `context.md` frontmatter) are skipped unless `all`. Only check that their files still exist.

## Checks

Run `date` first. For every agent in scope, run `wc -c` on the files below in one call (glob the paths, then one `wc -c` per agent). Read files only where a check needs content; use Grep where a pattern is enough.

### A. Startup cost (what the agent reads before it says hello)

Sum the bytes of: workspace `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` + the master it extends (count once per report; the master is `.agents/agents-framework/agents/CONVENTIONS.md` — if missing, use 27,000), `soul.md`, `name.md`, `role.md`, `autonomy.md`, `agents/tools/INDEX.md`, `tools.md`, `actions.md`, `MEMORY.md`, every file in `memory/standing/`, the 2 newest files in `memory/sessions/`, `context.md`, and every path listed under its `## Startup Context`. Estimate tokens as bytes ÷ 4.

| Tokens | Grade |
|--------|-------|
| ≤ 25k | ✅ |
| 25k–50k | ⚠️ |
| > 50k | ❌ |

Always name the **single biggest file** and its share. That is the fix.

### B. Tracker (`actions.md`)

- ❌ missing file.
- ❌ file > 40 KB; ⚠️ > 20 KB.
- ❌ the `Last reviewed:` line is longer than 600 characters, or contains "Prior review" more than once. Session narrative has been stuffed into the header; it belongs in `memory/sessions/` (one file per session) with the header cut to one line.
- ⚠️ no `Last reviewed:` line; ⚠️ its date is > 14 days old; ❌ > 45 days old.
- ⚠️ Open section has no `### P1` / `### P2` / `### P3` sub-sections.
- ⚠️ more than 8 open P1 rows (count table rows under `### P1` before the next heading).
- ⚠️ Open contains struck-through rows: the Action cell starts with `~~` (a done item left in Open). Strikethrough inside a live item's text (`~~algorithm HTML~~ (received) + SQL source`) is fine.
- ⚠️ Completed table has rows dated more than 30 days ago and `actions-archive.md` exists (they should be archived); ⚠️ `actions-archive.md` missing.
- ⚠️ Open rows whose Status does not start with `Not started`, `In progress`, `Waiting on` or `Parked` (master § actions.md; case does not matter): give the count and the item numbers, e.g. `3 of 30 statuses free-text (#4, #9, #12)`. A free-text status hides who the item waits on, so `/agents-status` and `/agents-next` cannot list it under the right person. Fix: move those rows onto the four states at the next wrap (`reference/session-end.md` § Step 2).
- ℹ️ Open rows whose Action cell does not start with a bold label (`**…**`), or whose leading bold phrase is longer than 60 characters (master § actions.md): give the count, e.g. `12 of 30 items without a label`. No fix needed now; rows get one when next touched at a wrap (`reference/session-end.md` § Step 2) or at a tracker cleanup.
- ⚠️ any row whose Status cell starts `Waiting on` (or says blocked / gated / awaiting) for more than 30 days (compare the row's date if it has one; otherwise skip).

### C. Memory

- ❌ more than 5 files in `memory/standing/` or more than 10 in `memory/sessions/` (consolidation is overdue: master § Baseline Consolidation).
- ❌ any single file in `memory/standing/` > 15 KB (consolidate: situational rules and exact detail move to the agent's `reference/` with pointers; data dumps move to `work/` or `knowledge/` with a one-page summary).
- ⚠️ `MEMORY.md` > 6 KB.
- ⚠️ `MEMORY.md` links (`[[name]]` or `memory/...` paths) that match no file in `memory/**` (grep the names, glob for them).
- If `reference/` exists (agent-level, not the framework's): ⚠️ a file in it has no line under `## Reference` in `MEMORY.md` containing `Read when`; ⚠️ a `reference §N` / `<file> §N` pointer in `memory/standing/` whose file has no heading starting `## N.` (grep the pointers, then the headings). Reference files are not counted in startup cost and have no size limit.
- ⚠️ newest file in `memory/sessions/` older than the tracker's `Last reviewed` date by more than 7 days (sessions ran without a memory entry).

### D. Files and wiring

- ❌ any of these missing: `role.md`, `soul.md`, `name.md`, `autonomy.md`, `tools.md`, `actions.md`, `context.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/standing/`, `memory/sessions/`.
- ❌ a path under `## Startup Context` in `context.md` that does not exist. Skip placeholder bullets such as `(none yet …)`. ⚠️ a bullet there that is not a workspace path at all (a URL, a wiki page name, prose): the agent cannot load it at startup; move it to the body of `context.md`.
- ⚠️ a path under `## Startup Context` points into the agent's `reference/` (reference files are read on demand, never at startup).
- ⚠️ `memory/scheduled/` exists (left over from the unhardened framework, which ran unattended ticks). Fold any `UNPROCESSED` entries into the tracker at the next session, then archive the folder.
- ⚠️ `peer/` has more than 10 files (fix: tracker cleanup archives them; `peer/archive/` is not counted), or any file with `status: open` older than 7 days (an exchange that failed or a handover nobody picked up; if the file already holds a reply, only its status is stale). Name the `needs-principal` files: they wait on the principal.
- ⚠️ a playbook (`playbooks/*.md`) has no `## Trigger` section. ℹ️ `playbooks/` is empty (normal for a new agent; mention once, no fix needed).
- ℹ️ active agent whose `Last reviewed` is > 60 days old: suggest retiring it (`status: retired` in `context.md`).

### E. Workspace level (once per report)

- ❌ `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` missing or without `extends:` in frontmatter.
- ⚠️ `reserved:` list in that frontmatter does not match the agent directories (names missing from the list, or listed names with no directory). Compare case-insensitively: `Ned` in the list matches `agents/ned/`.
- ⚠️ `agents/tools/INDEX.md` missing.
- ⚠️ the instruction files' `## Agents` table (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, whichever exist) lists an agent that is retired or missing, or omits an active one.
- ℹ️ `git status --short agents/` shows uncommitted changes (list the count only).
- ⚠️ two or more active agents' `tools.md` (or `context.md`) name the same code repository path outside the workspace and it is not a `<repo>.wt/<agent>` worktree path: they share one checkout. Fix: each owner moves to its own worktree (master conventions § Code Repositories).

### F. Security posture (once per report)

Read-only checks. Report; never fix. These catch drift from the hardened setup.

- ❌ `.agents/agents-framework/agents/CONVENTIONS.md` missing, or `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` `extends:` points outside the workspace (absolute path, `..`, URL, or the word `plugin`).
- ❌ any file in the workspace (excluding `.git/`) matching these unattended-run or persistence patterns: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `--approval-mode yolo`, `--yolo`, `cursor-agent -p --force`, `launchctl load`, `crontab -`, `LaunchAgents`. Use Grep. Name each file and line. Skip `.agents/` and `.claude/skills/` (the framework and these skills name the patterns in order to forbid them).
- ❌ a `scheduler/` folder, `scheduled-tasks.md`, `tick.sh`, `install-launchd.sh`, or `gate.py` under `agents/` (leftovers of the unhardened scheduler). Fix: the principal removes them and checks `launchctl list` / `crontab -l` for a leftover job.
- ⚠️ a harness permission file the installer manages is missing: `.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code), `.cursor/cli.json` (Cursor), `.codex/config.toml` (Codex), `.gemini/settings.json` (Gemini), `opencode.json` (OpenCode) — check only the harnesses listed in `.agents/agents-framework/harnesses`.
- ⚠️ one of those files exists but has no deny rule for `git push` (Claude, Cursor, OpenCode), or has `network_access = true` / `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` (Codex), or lacks `"disableYoloMode": true` (Gemini). Fix: the principal runs `scripts/verify.sh <workspace>` from the framework checkout and reviews the diff.
- ⚠️ text that looks like a secret in agent files: Grep `agents/` for `-----BEGIN`, `ghp_`, `github_pat_`, `xox[abp]-`, `sk-`, `AKIA`, `password:`, `api_key`, `token:`. Name the file only; never print the match.
- ℹ️ `pi` listed in `.agents/agents-framework/harnesses`: Pi has no tool-approval gate, so nothing enforces the deny list there.

## Output

Heading: `# Agent Workspace Health — <today's date>` (no hardcoded project name).

1. **Scorecard** — one row per agent, single-line cells, `|` replaced with `·`:

   | Agent | Startup | Tracker | Memory | Files | Top issue |
   |-------|---------|---------|--------|-------|-----------|

   Startup shows the token estimate and grade, e.g. `44k ⚠️`. The other columns show the worst grade in that group. Top issue is ≤ 10 words. Add a Scope column only if more than one scope exists.

2. **Findings** — ❌ first, then ⚠️, then ℹ️. One line each: `❌ Balbus — actions.md is 93 KB; the Last reviewed line holds ~80 KB of nested session narrative.` Group by agent. Skip checks that passed; do not pad.

3. **Do this next** — at most 3 items, highest leverage first. Each names the agent, the fix in one sentence, and the exact command to start it, e.g.:
   - `/agents-start Balbus tracker cleanup — cut the Last reviewed line to one sentence and move the history into session memories`
   - `/agents-start Cato consolidate memory`
   - `/agents-new` is never a doctor recommendation; `/agents-init` only if E fails.

4. If everything passes: say so in one line and stop.

**Deep report** (`/agents-doctor <name>`): same layout for one agent, plus a table of every startup file with bytes and share, largest first.

Do not fix anything. Do not commit.
